The challenge:

Challenge two

Within a new github repository, create some JavaScript (use jQuery and/or other frameworks if you wish) which loads images and displays them on a web page. 

The image can then be assigned to an email address.

Your webpage should contain an input field that accepts an email address, which is validated. 

On submission, the image is linked to the email address. 

A new image will then display which can be linked to another email address, or the same email address. 

If the email address has multiple linked images - please display this. 

The JavaScript should be in a seperate file from the HTML and the solution should run entirely in the browser without the need to be hosted on a web server.
